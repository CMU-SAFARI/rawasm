# Overview
Rawasm is the first software tool that enables the construction of genome assembly from raw nanopore signals.
It mostly reuses the miniasm (https://github.com/lh3/miniasm) features, but adds support to FAST5, POD5 and SLOW5 formats.
Rawasm can be used in pipelining with RawHash2 (https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash), using Rawsamble overlapping feature.
